                I've been playing tennis since childhood and am an avid fan of the sport. 
                I played on the Varsity team throughout high school as the top singles player but I love to play doubles as well. 
                In addition to tennis I enjoy playing badminton, table tennis, and recently have picked up pickleball.

                Growing up in South Orange County, I have done almost every local hike with my friends and family. 
                Moreover, we've visited many of the national parks, including

                In the last year, I have also begun going on local biking trails with friends every weekend. 
                Whenever I visit a new location, I always try to capture a few good photos to add to my phone's lockscreen. 
                Some of my favorites are showcased above <ArrowUp className="inline-block w-4 h-4 align-text-bottom font-bold text-sky-300"/>

                When I got my Kindle in high school, it let me reconnect with reading in a way I hadn't since grade school. 
                Nowadays, it's a nightly ritual of mine to read for a couple of minutesâ€¦or more before going to bed. 
                My favorite series that I've read in recent years is
                <Link href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/117100-red-rising-saga" className="text-sky-300 md:text-gray-200 font-bold hover:text-sky-300"> Red Rising</Link>
                , but my all-time favorite novel is 
                <Link href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17165596-the-kite-runner?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=A7zxEU9fpe&rank=1" className="text-gray-200 font-bold hover:text-sky-300"> The Kite Runner </Link>.
                I'm always on the lookout for new books, so if you have any reccs, don't hesitate to
